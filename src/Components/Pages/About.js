                                The website will function as an SPA "single page app" and consist of a header, with selectable menu, home page, services page, and about page.  
                                Routers and hooks will be used in development.  We be using Visual Studio Code as our 
                                Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  If you do not have VisualStudio Code installed 
                                goto https://code.visualstudio.com/download and follow the instructions. If you do not have Node.js on your computer you will need to install
                                it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ .  Included with Node.js is Node.js pachage manager (NPM).
